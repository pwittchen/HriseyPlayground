Hrisey Playground
================

Playing with Hrisey to remove boilerplate code from Android projects

##Setup

In order to use Hrisey, you need to install Hrisey plugin for Android Studio (IntelliJ): https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7462

##Important issue

Up to now (2014-12-10) Hrisey may not work correctly with [Retrolambda plugin for Android](https://github.com/evant/gradle-retrolambda). It may be issue connected with Lombok project.
